## Reflections
Each module contained basic information about working with TS. As a result of mastering each module, valuable information was obtained about working with TS.

**Getting Started with TypeScript**

This module provided captivating insights into language compatibility and the intricate connections that exist among them. Moreover, discovering the process of installing these languages on your computer was equally engaging.

**Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**

Exploring the diverse types of data within this language was intriguing, especially discovering their categorization into distinct subgroups. It was particularly surprising to learn about a type of "ani" capable of representing any meaning. Additionally, delving into tuples, where arrays contain various data types, provided valuable insights. I have explored the distinction between "any" and "unknown" types in this language.

**Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**

The study covered the concept of interfaces, encompassing their syntax, the rationale behind their usage, and methods for extending them. Additionally, knowledge was acquired regarding type aliases and their distinctions from interfaces.

**Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**

The study focused on understanding the creation of functions in this language, including named, anonymous, and arrow functions. It covered various aspects such as function parameters, which can be required, optional, default, or part of a deconstructed object.

**Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**

The study began with an examination of classes and their components. This involved practical exercises in creating classes and their instances. Additionally, the exploration delved into access modifiers and static properties, as well as extending classes through inheritance. Moreover, attention was given to understanding and implementing getter and setter methods.

**Generics in TypeScript**

In this module, we delved into the concept of generics, understanding their purpose and applications. This understanding was reinforced through practical exercises, specifically in the implementation of generics.

**Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**

In this module, we explored the organization of code using modules, employing statements to delineate relationships between them, such as import and export. Through practical exercises, we solidified skills in exporting and importing module components, as well as compiling modules. Additionally, we gained proficiency in utilizing type libraries and learned how to integrate them into our projects.

**Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**

In this module, I delved into the concept of namespaces, understanding their purpose and practical applications. This included exploring how code with a multi-file namespace is organized. Additionally, I gained insights into the distinctions between namespaces and modules, enhancing my understanding of code structuring and organization.
