## Presentation Transcript
First, let's figure out what decentralized applications are, since blockchain underlies their creation.
Decentralized apps (DApps) run on decentralized networks instead of central servers. They use blockchain for secure data storage. DApps aren't controlled by any single entity, as data is stored across multiple network nodes. This makes them flexible and adaptable to change, boosting their importance in today's world.

Blockchain is a game-changer for data storage and transmission, fueling the rise of decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies. It operates as a distributed ledger, securing data in blocks linked through cryptography.

Each block in a blockchain contains data, along with a hash of the previous block and a timestamp. This creates a chain of blocks, as each one points to the one before it. Blockchains are immutable, meaning once data is added, it can't be deleted or altered without changing the entire chain. This ensures data integrity and prevents tampering through a domino effect.

Blockchain consists of blocks linked in a chain, with no central control. It's decentralized, meaning no single entity governs it. The distributed ledger stores transaction copies. Smart contracts automate transactions without intermediaries. Consensus ensures data accuracy by agreement among network participants.

In decentralized applications, power is spread among smaller units. For a distributed database, agreement is needed on which records to add. Consensus algorithms facilitate this by ensuring participants agree on valid transactions for the blockchain. Validators stake a deposit to participate, risking loss for dishonest behavior but earning rewards for adding blocks. Transparency prevents cheating, as the cost of adding incorrect data exceeds the cost of verification.

Two main consensus algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

In PoW, miners compete to solve complex problems to add blocks to the blockchain and earn rewards. It's secure but requires a lot of energy and allows participants to join and leave freely.

In PoS, the chance of adding a block depends on the amount of cryptocurrency owned. More cryptocurrency means a higher chance, but it's like a lottery where everyone has a shot, with better odds for those with more coins. PoS is energy-efficient but can create hierarchy based on wealth.

The choice of consensus algorithm depends on the project's needs, goals, and conditions of use. It's crucial for security, efficiency, and sustainability.

Blockchain transactions record asset movement between parties. Network participants confirm validity, transactions are recorded in blocks, and the updated ledger is shared with all participants.

Blockchain transactions involve transferring digital assets or data between participants, akin to sending money between bank accounts. Instead of trusting a central authority, transactions are verified and recorded on a distributed ledger. The process includes:

Initiating a Transaction: Sender specifies recipient, asset amount, and additional details.
Transaction Signature: Sender uses private key to create a digital signature, confirming authenticity.
Balance Check: Sender verifies sufficient assets.
Sending to Network: Transaction is sent to blockchain network for verification.
Verification: Other participants confirm sender's assets and authority.
Block Inclusion: Verified transaction is added to a new block.
Transaction Completion: Assets or data are transferred to recipient upon inclusion in a block.

Blockchain simplifies finance between entities by providing a secure, transparent, and real-time transaction recording system. This reduces fraud risks and enhances trust between parties.

Blockchain employs two main cryptographic methods: public key cryptography and hash functions. Public key cryptography uses a pair of keys - private and public - for secure data verification and encryption. Hash functions convert input data into unique fixed-length strings. Unlike banking systems, which use symmetric encryption, blockchain's approach enhances security by using asymmetric encryption, where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

Blockchain is an innovative technology enhancing data storage and transmission, offering security, transparency, and decentralization. It's utilized across industries like finance, logistics, and healthcare, streamlining processes and fostering efficiency. With ongoing advancements, its adoption and impact on digital innovation will only grow.
